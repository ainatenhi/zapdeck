## Development Plan

### Design-First Approach

The development process started with the visual design of the application. Initial mockup was created in Illustrator to plan the layout, which allowed to visualize the final result and define precise dimensions and element positioning before starting development.

### 1. Main Circle Dimensions Calculation

![Circle Dimensions](./src/assets/01.svg)

Calculate possible dimensions for the main circle considering minimum margins from canvas edges:

- **Canvas**: CANVAS_WIDTH × CANVAS_HEIGHT = 1920 × 1080px
- **Center point**: CENTER_X = 960px, CENTER_Y = 540px
- **Minimum margin**: 120px from all sides
- **Size constraints**: All candidate diameters are multiples of 16, generated by decrementing the initial value in steps of 32.
- **Algorithm**: aₙ = a₀ − 32·n
- **Selected diameter**: CIRCLE_DIAMETER = 688px
- **Selected radius**: CIRCLE_RADIUS = 344px
- **Valid sizes sequence**: 848 (1/4: 212), 816 (1/4: 204), 784 (1/4: 196), 752 (1/4: 188), 720 (1/4: 180), 688 (1/4: 172), 656 (1/4: 164), 624 (1/4: 156), 592 (1/4: 148), 560 (1/4: 140), 528 (1/4: 132), 496 (1/4: 124), 464 (1/4: 116), 432 (1/4: 108), 400 (1/4: 100), 368 (1/4: 92), 336 (1/4: 84), 304 (1/4: 76), 272 (1/4: 68), 240 (1/4: 60), 208 (1/4: 52), 176 (1/4: 44), 144 (1/4: 36), 112 (1/4: 28)px - 24 sizes total

**Geometric positioning rule**: Main circle is centered at (CENTER_X, CENTER_Y), creating a fixed reference point for all subsequent elements

### 2. Small Circles Intersection Verification

![Small Circles Intersection](./src/assets/02.svg)

Verify that small circles placed on the main circle do not intersect:

- **Method**: Divide the main circle into equal parts
- **Maximum points**: 9 points on the circle
- **Small circle size**: 1/4 of main circle diameter
- **Result**: Confirmed that circles do not intersect with maximum 9 points distribution

### 2.1. Point Position Calculation (Trigonometric Rule)

- **Angle distribution**: Each point receives an angle `θ = (i · 360° / totalPoints) − 90°` to ensure the first point is placed at the **top** of the circle
- **Coordinate mapping**:
  - `x = CENTER_X + R · cos(θ)`
  - `y = CENTER_Y + R · sin(θ)`
- **Result**: Points are evenly distributed around the circle with consistent starting orientation

### 3. Interactive Circle Generation

- **Trigger mechanism**: User clicks the “Generate Prompt” button
- **State update**: visiblePoints increments by 1 on each click
- **Recalculation rule**: For every new value of visiblePoints, all point positions are recomputed by evenly distributing them along the main circle
- **Rendering logic**: A new set of point components is generated dynamically based on updated angular positions
- **Result**: Points appear sequentially, each placed at its correct geometric position on the circle

### 4. Text Label Positioning

- **Positioning rule**: Each label is placed relative to the point's horizontal position with respect to `CENTER_X`
- **Offset logic**: Labels are shifted horizontally by `SMALL_CIRCLE_RADIUS + RECT_GAP`
- **Side selection**:
  - If the point lies on the **right half** of the canvas → label is placed **to the right**
  - If the point lies on the **left half** → label is placed **to the left**

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000
